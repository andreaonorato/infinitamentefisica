# infinitamentefisica

In 2020, I developed a website featuring a pre-booking system for private physics lessons, all of which were offered by a friend. The website's front-end was constructed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while PHP and MySQL powered the back-end. 
This website was hosted on a VPS and administered through Putty and FileZilla software.

Unfortunately, infinitamentefisica.it is no longer online.
